### App Walkthrough GIF
//My simulation was uninterruptedly being terminated even though it built successfully mutliple times. I did not get any errors prior to runtime in my code or dispalys. This is what was displayed prior to my simulation terminating. Please take a look at my code, I have made multiple attempts to fix this issue but could not figure out as to why. Sorry for all the difficulties I am causing you all, I know I am asking a lot. Any feedback on what error I am getting would be greatly appreciated.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had some difficulty running the simulation. I cannot run a full simulation even though the build is successful and I got no errors in my code prior to running the simulaation.
